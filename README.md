🕹️ X-O Game — Tic-Tac-Toe in the Browser

A fun and interactive browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe (X and O) game built using modern web technologies. This project demonstrates basic game mechanics, user interaction, and frontend logic for detecting game outcomes.

Tic-Tac-Toe — also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os — is a classic paper-and-pencil game where two players take turns filling a 3×3 grid. The first player to line up three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
